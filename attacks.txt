Attack 1:
We can send GET requests to arbitrary filepaths that are in our home directory from our webserver, since the server allows 
people to load the content of all of the files that exist inside the home directory. Therefore, that means that we can send a 
request such as http://192.168.26.3:8080/http.c, and a potential attacker can read the source code for the webserver to look 
for any vulnerabilities in the C code. Furthermore, the databases are also able to be pulled using a GET command, which allows 
for attackers to get a list of all users and hashed passwords, which they could try match it against rainbow tables and 
compromise user accounts. For example, sending a GET request to http://192.168.26.3:8080/zoobar/db/person/person.db would 
return the following output -

The attack is still limited because we can't actually change any of the data, we can just view it. Also, the password is 
hashed. But we can still use the username and password hash combo to do nefarious things. This works because the server code 
in http.c just appends "/home/httpd/lab"  to retrieve a path, which allows us to fetch all of the data stored in 
"/home/httpd/lab/", including all of the source code and databases. A fix that we could do would be to move all the sensitive 
code outside of the lab directory and in somewhere safer on the cs263 VM. Note that we wouldn't be able to use the same trick 
by doing someting like "GET /../../../home/httpd/your/directory" because the webserver parses out the ".." from the URL. 



Attack 2:
An attacker could implement a denial of service attack.
