Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_exstack.py trigger?

This exploit triggers the buffer overflow that overflows the reqpath variable in zookd.c:65, overwriting the return address
of process_client. 

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner.

Most of the other buffer overflows from bugs.txt can be exploited in the same style, most notably the reqpath[2048] buffer, 
value[512], envvar[512], and the pn[1024] buffer, since all of these buffers are on the stack and can be attacked to overwrite 
return address and hijack program flow. However, the bug that allows us to overflow buf[8192] can't be exploited in the same way, because it is a static buffer and doesn't live on the stack.
