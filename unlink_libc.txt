Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_libc_1.py trigger?

This triggers the reqpath[2048] buffer overflow and overwrites the return address of process_client in zookd.

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner (as in unlink_libc_1.py).

Since we're really just hijacking program control by overflowing and rewriting the return address of the function, we can 
exploit all of the buffer overflows except for the one involving the static buf[8172], because all of the other exploits other 
than buf can also rewrite the return address of its parent function into a libc address.



Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_libc_2.py trigger?

This triggers the pn[1024] buffer overflow and overwrites the (*handler) function pointer in the same function. 

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner (as in unlink_libc_2.py).

The other buffer overflows cannot be exploited in the same way, because in this case we're overwriting a function pointer 
instead of the return address of the function. Since the other buffer overflows aren't near a function pointer, we can't 
really exploit them in the same way.
